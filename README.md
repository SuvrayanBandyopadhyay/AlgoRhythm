## Introduction 
We have built a full-stack music sharing platform to empower 
artists and music lovers by providing a space to upload, share 
and discover music. The platform allows the user to create their 
own profiles, upload tracks and download their favorite music.  
To develop this website, we have used React.js for a user-friendly 
frontend and Node.js for the backend. The database has been 
designed using MySQL, with additional security features such as 
password hashing to prevent data theft. 

## Features:

To ensure an enjoyable experience for our users, we have developed a clean, intuitive, and 
easy-to-use user interface. This thoughtfully designed interface allows users to effortlessly 
navigate the platform and quickly access a wide range of content. With features that 
highlight the latest uploads, most trending tracks, and the most popular items in our 
database, users can discover new music and artists with minimal effort.

In addition to browsing new content, users can enjoy seamless music playback directly from 
our website. Using the platformâ€™s integrated audio player, one can easily stream tracks 
without downloading them first. For added flexibility users can choose to download their 
favorite tracks as well.  

### Profiles

Each user also has a dedicated profile page where one can reach out to them and explore 
other tracks by the same artist. This allows people to actively engage with their listeners and 
showcase their work to a larger audience

We have a convenient site-wide search feature to help users find specific tracks no matter 
when, where or by whom they were uploaded. 

### Upload

While uploading their own work users are prompted to give song title and cover art. These 
songs are then available for all users on the site to enjoy.

their preference.
